# Optimizing Fertilizer Usage for Improved Crop Yields.


### Project Overview.

Analyze the relationship between fertilizer types and crop yields to provide data-driven recommendations for farmers and agricultural stakeholders.

Scope:
 - Investigate the impact of inorganic, organic, and mixed fertilizers on crop yields
 - Identify the most effective fertilizer types for specific crops (Soybean, Maize, Cotton)
 - Explore the potential benefits of crop rotation and planning.

### Data Source.
 - KAGGLE.

### Tools.
 - Power Query Editor- Data cleaning.
 - SQL-[Data Analysis]
 - Power-Bi [Creating report]

### Data cleaning/preparations.

In the initial data preparation phase, we performed the following task.
 - Data loading and inspection.
 - Handling missing values
 - Data cleabing and formatting.

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

#### Data Summary:
 - Number of observations
 - Number of variables
 - Data types: categorical (fertilizer type, crop type), numerical (crop yield)

#### Multivariate Analysis:
 - Interaction between fertilizer type, crop type, and crop yield

#### Data Visualization:
 - Bar charts to compare crop yields across fertilizer types
 - Scatter plots to visualize relationships between variables
 - Heatmaps to explore correlations between variables

#### Some potential questions to explore during EDA:

 - What are the most common fertilizer types used for each crop?
 - Are there any outliers or anomalies in the data?
 - How do crop yields vary across different fertilizer types and crop types?

### Data Analysis.

Analysis of crop yields to determine the best fertilizer suitable for a particular crop types.

### Results/Findings 

The analysis results are summarized as 
 1. Soybean has the highest performance yield followed by Maize with total yields of 459K and 442k respectively.
 2. Inorganic fertilizer has a yield 682K, followed by Mixed fertilizer which yields 663K.
 3. The Central USA produces the highest yield followed by East Africa with 437K and 433K respectively. 


### Insights/Recommendation.

#### Insights--Crop Yield Rankings.

 1. Inorganic Fertilizer: Soybean has the highest yield (682.55k).
 2. Organic Fertilizer: Maize has the highest yield (670.52k).
 3. Mixed Fertilizer: Cotton has the highest yield (663.39k).

#### Insights-- Fertilizer Type Comparison.

 1. Inorganic Fertilizer tends to perform best for Soybean
 2. Organic Fertilizer tends to perform best for Maize
 3. Mixed Fertilizer tends to perform best for Cotton

### Recommendation

#### Fertilizer Optimization*:
 - For Soybean farmers, consider using Inorganic Fertilizer to maximize yields
 - For Maize farmers, consider using Organic Fertilizer to maximize yields
 - For Cotton farmers, consider using Mixed Fertilizer to maximize yields
#### Crop Rotation and Planning
 - Farmers may want to consider rotating crops to optimize fertilizer usage and minimize waste
 - Planting multiple crops that respond well to the same fertilizer type can help reduce costs and increase efficiency.

### Limitations 

I have to remove Zero values from the Yield column which could affect the accuracy all my analysis.
